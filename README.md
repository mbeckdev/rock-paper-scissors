# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a rock paper scissors game you play against the computer.

HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT

## Notes

- I used some pictures that I drew of a hilarious rock, paper, and scissors.
- Check out the CSS animations! These can get complicated real quick. I was having fun trying to get it to shake the fist properly, and then if it won, put the fist on top of the other one. I learned you can do a lot with animations.
- Keyframes are your friend when doing CSS animations.

## Other Notes

- Press m to enable cheat mode - you can see a small blue box on the top left letting you know it's on.
- Next time, maybe not make it in one giant JavaScript file. This file seems really long.  If I did it again, I might try it in React.
